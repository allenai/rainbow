Neural models of common sense.

[This repository][source] is for the paper: Unicorn on Rainbow: A Universal
Commonsense Reasoning Model on a New Multitask Benchmark. Unicorn on Rainbow
introduces a new evaluation, *the cost equivalent curve*, which compares models
in terms of their cost-benefit trade offs. Using cost equivalent curves, we
conduct a large-scale empirical study of intermediate-task transfer for common
sense. With findings from this study, we created a new state-of-the-art model
for commonsense reasoning: Unicorn.

This repository provides code for constructing cost equivalent curves, training
and running Unicorn, and reproducing our experiments.

For information on specific subjects, see the following docs:

  - **[Development][development]**: Set up, run, or extend this code.
  - **[Analyzing Results][analyzing-results]**: Download our experimental
    results (training curves, learning curves, results tables, extra figures,
    etc.) and/or reproduce our analysis pipeline.
